This is a block list of sites that can be added to your browser/extensions to block ai features. 

# Intended Options
## uBlock Origin
Because I use Firefox and Qutebrowser, I am unsure if this will work on Chrome/Chromium based browsers.
This will be tested on Brave and Google Chromium (with uBlock Lite) to see if this will work.
### Adding to uBlock Origin
To add this block list, do the following:
1. Go to `uBlock Settings > Filter lists`
<img width="205" height="52" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c16fca7-40ec-4691-8191-fa7b4f2f0ad6" />

2. Add `https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=encoded-url&title=optional-encoded-title` to your My Filters
> The url in the `https://subscribe.adblockplus.org` will change when I get `https://rubyspace.net` running. It will be found under [https://git.rubyspace.net/raw/ai-blacklist.txt](https://git.rubyspace.net/raw/ai-blacklist.txt) 

3. Click `Save`
